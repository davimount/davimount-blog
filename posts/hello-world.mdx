Welcome to my small blog! I've always wanted to start one and here we are - I can't wait to embark on this exciting journey with you. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with programming, I hope to provide you information, tips, and inspiration.

I'll be posting thoughts and findings, and fast solutions to problems I'll solve during time.

My name is Davide Mantovani but colleagues just call me `Dave`. I'm a Software Engineer graduated with Master's Degree in 2015, a programming teacher, a theatre actor and director. You'll know me better, at some point.

For now, let me welcome you with 10 different Hello World in 10 different programming languages.

console.log("Hello, World!");
